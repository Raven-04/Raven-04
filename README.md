- 👋 Hi, I’m @Raven-04
- 👀 I’m interested in Video games, anime, animals, learning new things, any form of geek content.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms using c++ in my university and as for Javascript as a self study.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on personal/collaborative projects to hopefully learn more about coding and computer science.
- 📫 How to reach me Tera.Cell.0101@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him (though I don't really care about pronouns, a human is a human no matter their pronouns).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I had a cat that once scratched my eye, almost blinding my right eye. Thankfully, it has healed since then.
- Current Programming Languages: c++, html, cpp, and javascript.
